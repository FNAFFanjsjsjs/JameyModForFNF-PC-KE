# VS Jamey but for your 200 gb ram android device
Here you will find the source code to the Android Kade Engine build of the Jamey Mod.
this is a very bad do not use lol

im gonna be honest this mods probobly gonna suck

# RP4's note
Lmao welcome to my mod
I don't expect this to be overly big, but 1k special lmao
If you like the mod you can do a PC Port to android but I'm doing a android port and that's final



# Daninnocent's Note
not all of kade engine features will work here for example like modcharts and shit
so just beware this is not a full in kade engine port for android it never was lol
it's just for vs jamey

and also note to rp4's note he's just gonna do a port of vs jamey on 
the luckydog's engine rather than using kade engine lol

credits to luckydog7 for being a god and making this possible tho lol!
